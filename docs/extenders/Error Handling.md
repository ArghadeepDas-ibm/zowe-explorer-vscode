## Objectives

By following this best practices, Zowe Explorer extenders will be able to provide a meaningful error message and help users identify the root cause of the problem quickly and easily.

We encourage extenders to use this guidance in order to:

- Help users understand which extension is causing an error, by including the name of the extension in the error message.
- Give developers more information in error logs.
- Standardize the error message format across all of Zowe Explorer's extenders.

## Error Message Format

We highly recommend the usage of this Error message format:

```
Extension Name Error - Error Message
```

Ex. Zowe Explorer FTP extension, the message would look like:

```
Zowe Explorer FTP Extension Error - Unable to delete nodeâ€¦
```

## Logging of Error Message

We highly recommend the usage of `imperative.Logger` in logging the extenders error messages.

These logs have a stardard format that is used by Zowe Explorer and will have a consistency across Zowe components.

Example:

```
public constructor(protected log: imperative.Logger) {}
  try {
  ...
  } catch (error) {
      this.log.error(error);
  }
```

## Showing Errors to Users

We highly recomend to use VSCode's API to show messages to users. This will provide a standard format
that is similar to Zowe Explorer and VSCode.

- For showing information to the user: [vscode.window.showInformationMessage](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#window.showInformationMessage)

```
vscode.window.showInformationMessage(
                localize("findUSSItem.unsuccessful", "File does not exist. It
                may have been deleted.")
            );
```

- For showing errors to the user: [vscode.window.showErrorMessage](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#window.showErrorMessage)

```
vscode.window.showErrorMessage(
                localize("deactivate.error", "Unable to delete temporary
                folder. ") + err
            );
```

- If the extender isn't implementing one of Zowe Explorer's APIs, it is very important to throw a `not implemented` error for that API. [See an example of this from the FTP extension](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/blob/8080ae14734eb9673b178687d92df94e203aad35/packages/zowe-explorer-ftp-extension/src/ZoweExplorerFtpMvsApi.ts#L200).

```
public allocateLikeDataSet(dataSetName: string, likeDataSetName: string):
                Promise<zowe.IZosFilesResponse> {
                  throw new Error("Allocate like dataset is not supported in ftp
                  extension.");
            }
```
